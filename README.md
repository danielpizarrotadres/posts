- ### 1.2 Where are computers
        
    - [ ] Computers are everywhere. They are in people's pockets, they are in people's cars, people have them on theirs wrists, they might be in your backpack righ now.

- ### 1.3 What does make a computer a computer anyway and how does it even works?
        
    - [ ] As humans, we have been always built tools to help us solve problems. Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor trailer. All of these inventions helped us with manual work.

    - [ ] All of these inventions helped us with manual work. Over time, people began to wonder if a machine could be designed and built to help us with the thinking work we do. Like solving equations or tracking the starts in the sky. Rather than moving or manipulating physical things, like dirt and stone, these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information.

    - [ ] As the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine, they realized that it had to perform four different tasks:
        - Input
        - Store information
        - Process it
        - Output the results
        
        Now this might sound simple, but these four things are common to all computers. And that is what makes a computer a computer.

- ### 1.4 How was the earliest computers?

    - [ ] The earliest computers were made out of wood and metal with mechanical levers and gears.
    
    - [ ] By the 20th century though, computers started using electrical components. These early computers were really large and really slow. A computer the size of a room might take hours just to add a basic math problem.
    
    - [Â ] These machines are things of gleaming, varied colored metal and numerous flashing lights. Computers started out as basic calculators, which was already really awesome at the time and they were only manipulating numbers back then. But now we can use them to talk to each other, we can use them to play games, control robots, and do any crazy thing that you could probably imagine. Modern computers look nothing like those clunky old machines, but they still do the same four things.
    
- ### 1.5 Input

    - [ ] Is the stuff that the world does, or that you do that makes the computer do stuff. You can tell them a computer what to do with the keyboard, you ca tell them what to do with the mouse, the microphone, the camera, and now if you are warning a computer on your wrist, it might listen to yout heatbeat, or in you car it might be listening to what car is doing. And a touchscreen can actually sense your finger and it takes that as input on what itt is doing.

    - [ ] All these different inputs give the computer information, which is then stored in memory. A computer's processor takes information for memory. It manipulates it or changes it using algorithm, which is just a series of commands, and then it sends the process information back to be stored in memory again. This continues until the processed information is ready to be output.

- ### 1.6 Output
    
    - [ ] How a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do. A computer display can show texts, photos, videos, or interactive games, even virtual reallity. The outut of a computer  may even include signal to control a robot. And when computers connect over the internet, the output from one computer becomes the input to another, and vice versa.
