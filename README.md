    - [ ] Computers are everywhere. They are in people's pockets, they are in people's cars, people have them on theirs wrists, they might be in your backpack righ now.

    - [ ] As humans, we have been always built tools to help us solve problems. Tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, or a tractor trailer. All of these inventions helped us with manual work.

    - [ ] All of these inventions helped us with manual work. Over time, people began to wonder if a machine could be designed and built to help us with the thinking work we do. Like solving equations or tracking the starts in the sky. Rather than moving or manipulating physical things, like dirt and stone, these machines would need to be designed to manipulate information.

    - [ ] As the pioneers of computer science explored how to design a thinking machine, they realized that it had to perform four different tasks:
        - Input
        - Store information
        - Process it
        - Output the results
